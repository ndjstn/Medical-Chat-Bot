# Medical Chatbot

**Project Overview: Medical Chatbot**

The advent of technology has greatly influenced various industries including healthcare. One of the strides towards integrating technology with health services has been the development of a Medical Chatbot designed to assist patients with medical queries. This project aimed to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a responsive, intelligent chat system to guide patients accurately and efficiently.

The core goal of the Medical Chatbot was to offer reliable and instant responses to patients seeking medical information before possibly seeing a health professional. The chatbot was programmed to interpret and respond to a wide range of inquiries, from symptoms and disease insights to advice on first aid and medications. Every interaction was designed to be user-friendly to ensure that even users without technical backgrounds could find it easy and intuitive to use.

Developing the Medical Chatbot required strategic incorporation of NLP tools and technologies. Key components involved setting up a language processing system that could understand and mimic human interactions. The chatbot was trained with large datasets comprising medical textbooks, verified medical articles, and pre-existing medical inquiry transcripts to enhance its accuracy and ability to handle a diverse set led of questions.
